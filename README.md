# NumberGuessing.py
Just a number guessing python code that'll guess a Number that you think. For example if you say the lowest number is 0 and highest is 100 (yeah It'll work even when you choosing from 0 to billion too). So it'll try guessing and you gotta say if your number is higher or lower than the predicted number. Yeah I know this is a weird python code
